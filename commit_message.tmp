feat(contracts): add placeholder ZK proof verification

Replaces the council-based voting mechanism in the DisputeResolver with a more robust, extensible system based on ZK-proof verification.

This commit, developed via strict TDD, introduces:
- A new `resolveDisputeWithProof` function to handle ZK-based resolution.
- An `IVerifier` interface and a placeholder `Groth16Verifier` mock contract for testing.
- The ability to set a ZK Verifier address on the `DisputeResolver`.
- Refactoring of the internal `_resolve` function to handle outcomes from both voting (legacy) and ZK proofs.

The existing voting mechanism (`resolveDispute`) is kept for now to ensure a phased rollout, but the foundation is now laid for a full transition to ZK-proofs.
