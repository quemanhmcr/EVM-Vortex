feat(challenger): implement basic challenger service

This commit introduces the initial implementation of the zk-challenger service. It listens for DataProposed events, applies a basic fraud detection rule, and automatically calls the challengeData function if fraudulent data is detected.

The e2e test script has been updated to launch both the witness and challenger services, demonstrating a full happy/unhappy path loop. All linting and dependency issues discovered during the final quality check have been resolved.
